      desc1:` Our boy Coco can't wait to meet you! He is a volunteer
      favorite for his quirky and spunky personality. He is a
      character with personality to spare. He has a bouncy hop to
      his step and is playful with toys and people. Coco also likes
      other dogs and has done well with them; it's a joy to watch
      him blossom in play. A confident, respectful dog in the home
      who can show him the ropes may be a good match for him.`,
      desc2:`He has been working on gaining confidence to be the best boy
      he can be. He can be nervous in some situations so he needs
      adopters who understand his needs to help him thrive. Positive
      reinforcement training will be a wonderful way to get to know
      and bond with Coco. He is smart and will need dog savvy,
      experienced adopters.`
